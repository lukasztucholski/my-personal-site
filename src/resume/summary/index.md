# Summary
I am currently working as a FrontEnd Developer mainly in the JavaScript framework ecosystem - **Vue.js**.

The applications we maintain (and write new ones) are mainly based on **Nuxt.js** - the Vue.js framework supporting Server-Side Rendering and Pre-Rendering.

We also use the benefits of the framework for UI components - **Vuetify**.

Privately, I am educating further towards Full-Stack Developer in **Node.js** and I also get to know another JavaScript framework - **React** with **TypeScript**.
